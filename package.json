  "description": "I live in an apartment complex with 20 units and 2 washing machines. There's been a number of times where I'd want to do my laundry, but someone else's laundry is still in the machine. I want to be courteous and wait 15 minutes before I even think about moving their clothes, but then I lose 15 minutes of laundry time. I personally avoid this by setting an alarm for 40 minutes so I know to come get my laundry when it is done. However, I know that not everyone does that and the urgency to get the clothes might not be that high.",
